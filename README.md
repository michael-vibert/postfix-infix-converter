# Postfix to Infix Converter 

Welcome to a recent project that I created as part of a challenge in a Algorithms 
and data  structures course. 

Computers don't process expressions in the same manner that we humans do.  
They prefer to read expressions in Postfix notation. 

Postfix notation is where all of the operands (the +/-/*/% etc) appear after  
the operands (the numbers). For example:
- instead of 5-4 or 6*7+4
- it becomes 54- or 674*+

For postfix expressions, the operations occur in the same order that they were written.

Infix notation is the normal, human readable method of writing expression. 

This project was about developing some understanding of how certain data structures  
work - as I created my own Stack ADT and Queue ADT. 

The InfixConverter Class includes the algorithm that converts the expressions from  
infix to postfix. 

It works only in that directs (Infix to Postfix) and does not deal with numbers that have  
more than one digit at this stage. 

Enjoy! Mike
